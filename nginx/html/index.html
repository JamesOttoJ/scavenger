		<h1>Welcome to CTFs!</h1>
		<h3>What is a CTF?</h3>
		<p>Did you ever play <strong>Capture the Flag</strong> as a kid? It's essentially that for computers! Designers will try and hide a "flag", and it is our job to try and find it. These flags usually follow a standard format. For example: CyberSec{fake_flag}. Every flag will start with CyberSec{ and end with } where it is your job to find out what is between</p>
		<h3>How do I get into CTFs?</h3>
		<p>Compete and join in the fun! The best way to get started is to just try some of the easy challenges to see how far you can go. It's important to keep in mind that "easy" challenges won't feel very easy at first, but google is always there to help you get a feel for what to do.</p>
		<br\>
		<p>While doing a CTF, it is important to note that most hackers don't solve every challenge by hand. Everyone uses tools to help, and the best way to get access to these tools is to start up a VM and install some kind of security-focused operating system like Kali or Parrot. <a href="https://parrotsec.org/docs/virtualization/install-parrot-on-virtualbox/">This guide</a> will help to get a VM up and running, but it's up to you to learn the tools and how linux works. On a similar note, challenges will often use linux with some being on Windows and a few on Mac/other, so it is important to get the basics of every operating system</p>
		<h3>What Kind of Challenges Are There?</h3>
		<p>Challenges typically fall into the following categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Web (These challenges)</li>
			<li>Reverse Engineering (Finding out how a program works</li>
			<li>Cryptography (Math)</li>
			<li>Hardware (Hacking cameras, cars, planes, and everything else)</li>
			<li>PWN (General hacking)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To learn more about what a category entails and how to get started, check out the <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S0LFMY55AN55aLW90tpuUKU0somo-lEX6bqPoAEaYQ0/edit?usp=sharing>slides</a> for a <a href="https://youtu.be/NSOjrcRPpFk">HACC (Hacking and Cybersecurity Club) presentation all about it</a></p>
